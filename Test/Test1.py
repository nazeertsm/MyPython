# This is a simple Python script that populates a list with integers from 1 to 10.

# Initialize an empty list.
l=[]

# Use a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers from 1 to 11.
for i in range(1,11):
   # Append each number to the list.
   l.append(i)

# Print the populated list.
print(l)
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
